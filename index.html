bit of a snicker) as “huge, overwhelming, and uncontrollable amounts of 
information.” In 1663, <a href="http://www.academia.dk/Blog/john-graunt-24-april-1620-18-april-1674-was-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Graunt</a>
 dealt with “overwhelming amounts of information” as well, while he 
studied the bubonic plague, which was currently ravaging Europe. Graunt 
used statistics and is credited with being the first person to use 
statistical data analysis. In the early 1800s, the field of statistics 
expanded to include collecting and analyzing data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Arial Black';">The evolution of <a href="http://www.dataversity.net/what-is-big-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Data</a>
 includes a number of preliminary steps for its foundation, and while 
looking back to 1663 isn’t necessary for the growth of data volumes 
today, the point remains that “Big Data” is a relative term depending on
 who is discussing it. Big Data to Amazon or Google is very different 
than Big Data to a medium-sized insurance organization, but no less 
“Big” in the minds of those contending with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Arial Black';">Such foundational steps to the modern conception of Big Data involve 
the development of computers, smart phones, the internet, and sensory 
(Internet of Things) equipment to provide data. Credit cards also played
 a role, by providing increasingly large amounts of data, and certainly 
social media changed the nature of data volumes in novel and still 
developing ways. The evolution of modern technology is interwoven with 
the evolution of Big Data</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Arial Black';"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Arial Black'; font-size: 18px;"><br></span></p></div>
